      <p>When a powerful storm tears through Central Texas, the damage can be devastating — ripped shingles, dented siding, shattered windows, and water pouring into your living room. You call your insurance company expecting help. But what you don't realize is that your insurer's primary goal is to <strong>minimize their payout</strong>, not maximize yours.</p>

      <p>After working with hundreds of Austin homeowners on storm damage claims, we've seen the same patterns over and over. Here are five things your insurance company hopes you never find out.</p>

      <h2>1. Their First Offer Is Almost Never the Full Amount</h2>
      <p>Insurance adjusters are trained to come in low. The first estimate they hand you is designed to test whether you'll accept it without pushing back. In our experience, initial offers can be <strong>30–60% lower</strong> than the actual cost of repairs.</p>
      <p>What to do: Never accept the first offer without getting an independent inspection. A qualified restoration contractor can document the full scope of damage and provide a detailed estimate that you can submit as a supplement to your claim.</p>

      <h2>2. You Have the Right to Choose Your Own Contractor</h2>
      <p>Many insurance companies will suggest — or even pressure you into — using their "preferred" contractors. What they won't tell you is that these contractors often have agreements with the insurer to keep costs low, which can mean <strong>cheaper materials and shortcuts</strong>.</p>
      <p>Texas law gives you the absolute right to hire any licensed contractor you choose. Pick someone who works <em>for you</em>, not for the insurance company.</p>

      <h2>3. There's a Hidden Depreciation Game</h2>
      <p>Your policy probably includes something called "recoverable depreciation." The insurer pays out the depreciated value first, then withholds the rest until repairs are completed. Many homeowners don't know they can <strong>recover that withheld amount</strong> — and insurers don't volunteer the information.</p>
      <p>Make sure you complete your repairs with a qualified contractor and file for the recoverable depreciation. It can mean thousands of extra dollars in your pocket.</p>

      <h2>4. Time Limits Can Kill Your Claim</h2>
      <p>Texas insurance policies have strict deadlines for filing claims, requesting supplements, and completing repairs. If you miss these windows, <strong>the insurer can deny your claim entirely</strong> — even if the damage is legitimate.</p>
      <p>After any storm, document damage immediately (photos, videos, written notes) and contact your insurer within 24–48 hours. Don't wait for "the next big rain" to see if your roof leaks.</p>

      <h2>5. You Can Reopen a Closed or Denied Claim</h2>
      <p>Got a denial letter? Don't give up. Many homeowners assume a denial is final, but in Texas you have the right to <strong>dispute, supplement, or reopen a claim</strong>. New evidence — like a second inspection revealing hidden damage — can completely reverse a denial.</p>
      <p>We've helped dozens of Austin families reopen claims that were initially denied, recovering tens of thousands of dollars they were owed.</p>

      <p>Nothing prepares you for the aftermath of a house fire. The smoke, the destruction, the overwhelming feeling of loss. But in those critical first 24 hours, the steps you take can make the difference between a successful insurance claim and a financial nightmare.</p>

      <p>This guide walks you through exactly what to do — from ensuring your family's safety to protecting your right to a full insurance payout.</p>

      <h2>Step 1: Ensure Everyone's Safety</h2>
      <p>Before anything else, make sure every person and pet is accounted for. <strong>Do not re-enter the home</strong> until the fire department has given the all-clear. Even after flames are out, structural damage, toxic fumes, and weakened floors pose serious dangers.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Call 911 immediately if you haven't already</li>
        <li>Move to a safe location away from the structure</li>
        <li>Account for all family members and pets</li>
        <li>Seek medical attention for any injuries, even minor smoke inhalation</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Step 2: Contact Your Insurance Company</h2>
      <p>Call your insurance company's claims hotline as soon as possible — ideally within the first few hours. Early notification is critical because most policies have <strong>time-sensitive filing requirements</strong>.</p>
      <p>When you call, write down:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your claim number</li>
        <li>The name of the adjuster assigned to you</li>
        <li>Any deadlines they mention</li>
        <li>What documentation they're requesting</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Step 3: Document Everything</h2>
      <p>Once it's safe to approach the property, start documenting. Your phone's camera is your best friend right now. This documentation will be the backbone of your insurance claim.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Take wide-angle photos of every room from multiple angles</li>
        <li>Photograph individual damaged items up close</li>
        <li>Record video walkthroughs narrating the damage</li>
        <li>Make written lists of every damaged or destroyed item</li>
        <li>Save all receipts for emergency expenses (hotel, food, clothing)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Step 4: Secure the Property</h2>
      <p>You have a legal obligation to prevent further damage to your property. This is called "<strong>mitigating damages</strong>," and failure to do so can give your insurer grounds to reduce your payout.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Board up broken windows and doors</li>
        <li>Cover roof holes with tarps</li>
        <li>Turn off water, gas, and electricity if safe to do so</li>
        <li>Keep all receipts for these emergency repairs</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Step 5: Don't Throw Anything Away</h2>
      <p>This is a mistake we see constantly. Homeowners, in their rush to clean up, throw away damaged items before the adjuster arrives. <strong>Do not discard anything</strong> — even items that look like total losses. The adjuster needs to see and document them.</p>

      <h2>Step 6: Call a Professional Restoration Team</h2>
      <p>A professional restoration company like Austin Insure can be invaluable in the first 24 hours. We provide:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Emergency board-up and tarping services</li>
        <li>Professional damage documentation that holds up with insurers</li>
        <li>Direct communication with your insurance adjuster</li>
        <li>A detailed scope of work that ensures nothing is missed</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Don't Navigate This Alone</h2>
      <p>A house fire is overwhelming enough without having to battle your insurance company. Austin Insure handles the entire claims process so you can focus on your family. Contact us for a <strong>free assessment</strong> — we're available 24/7 for emergencies.</p>

      <p>Your roof takes the brunt of every Texas storm. Hail, high winds, falling debris — the damage can range from a few missing shingles to a total roof replacement. But here's the problem: <strong>if you can't prove the damage to your insurer, they won't pay for it</strong>.</p>

      <p>Proper documentation is the single most important factor in getting your claim approved and fully paid. Here's exactly how to do it right.</p>

      <h2>Start From the Ground</h2>
      <p>Before anyone climbs on the roof, do a thorough ground-level inspection. Walk the entire perimeter of your home and look for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Shingles or roofing material on the ground</li>
        <li>Dented gutters and downspouts</li>
        <li>Damage to siding, window screens, and outdoor AC units</li>
        <li>Dents in mailboxes, fences, or cars (these prove hail size)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Photograph everything. These ground-level clues corroborate what's found on the roof and strengthen your claim.</p>

      <h2>Conduct a Roof Inspection (Safely)</h2>
      <p>We strongly recommend having a <strong>licensed professional</strong> inspect your roof. Walking on a damaged roof is dangerous and can cause additional damage. A professional knows exactly what to look for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hail impact marks on shingles (look for dark circular spots)</li>
        <li>Cracked, curled, or missing shingles</li>
        <li>Exposed underlayment or decking</li>
        <li>Compromised flashing around vents, chimneys, and skylights</li>
        <li>Granule loss in gutters (indicates shingle degradation)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Use the Right Photography Techniques</h2>
      <p>Insurance adjusters review hundreds of photos. Make yours count:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Wide shots</strong> showing the overall condition of the roof</li>
        <li><strong>Close-ups</strong> of individual damaged areas with something for scale (a coin or chalk circle)</li>
        <li><strong>Compass reference</strong> — note which slope (north, south, etc.) each photo shows</li>
        <li><strong>Date stamps</strong> — ensure your camera's date feature is on</li>
        <li><strong>Before photos</strong> — if you have any pre-storm photos of your roof, gather them</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Get a Professional Damage Report</h2>
      <p>This is where having a qualified restoration contractor makes all the difference. At Austin Insure, our inspection reports include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A detailed diagram of the roof with damage marked by slope</li>
        <li>Photo documentation keyed to each damaged area</li>
        <li>Material specifications and quantities needed for repair</li>
        <li>Industry-standard pricing using Xactimate software</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This type of professional report speaks the same language as insurance adjusters and dramatically increases approval rates.</p>

      <h2>Common Documentation Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Waiting too long after the storm (damage can worsen, and insurers get suspicious)</li>
        <li>Only photographing obvious damage (capture everything, even minor dents)</li>
        <li>Throwing away damaged materials before the adjuster sees them</li>
        <li>Not documenting interior damage (water stains, ceiling cracks)</li>
        <li>Relying solely on the insurance company's inspection</li>
      </ul>

    content: `
      <p>The adjuster came, looked at your roof for 20 minutes, and handed you an estimate. You glance at the number and your stomach drops — it's barely enough to cover half the repair. Sound familiar?</p>

      <p>You're not alone. Across Central Texas, homeowners consistently receive <strong>initial insurance estimates that are 30–60% below</strong> the actual cost of proper repairs. This isn't an accident — it's by design.</p>

      <h2>Insurance Companies Are Businesses First</h2>
      <p>Let's be clear: your insurance company is a for-profit business. Every dollar they pay on your claim is a dollar off their bottom line. Adjusters — even the well-meaning ones — operate within a system designed to <strong>control and minimize payouts</strong>.</p>
      <p>This doesn't make them evil. But it does mean you need to understand that their interests and yours are not aligned.</p>

      <h2>How Adjusters Keep Estimates Low</h2>
      <p>There are several common tactics:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Incomplete scope:</strong> They may only document obvious damage and miss hidden issues behind walls, under shingles, or in the attic</li>
        <li><strong>Below-market pricing:</strong> Using labor and material rates that don't reflect actual Austin-area costs</li>
        <li><strong>Depreciation deductions:</strong> Reducing the payout based on the age of your roof or materials, even when you're entitled to full replacement</li>
        <li><strong>Excluding related damage:</strong> Treating water damage, interior damage, and exterior damage as separate issues rather than connected storm damage</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Supplement Process: Your Secret Weapon</h2>
      <p>Here's what most homeowners don't know: you have the right to <strong>supplement your claim</strong>. This means submitting additional documentation, revised estimates, and new evidence to your insurer after the initial offer.</p>
      <p>A properly prepared supplement, backed by professional documentation and Xactimate pricing, can increase your payout by thousands — sometimes tens of thousands of dollars.</p>

      <h2>What a Professional Contractor Brings to the Table</h2>
      <p>When you partner with a restoration company like Austin Insure, we:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Conduct our own thorough inspection and find damage the adjuster missed</li>
        <li>Prepare a line-item estimate using the same software as insurers</li>
        <li>File supplements directly with your insurance company</li>
        <li>Negotiate on your behalf, speaking the adjuster's language</li>
        <li>Ensure every covered item is included in the final payout</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Real Numbers From Real Austin Claims</h2>
      <p>Here's what we've seen in recent Central Texas claims:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Initial offer: $8,200 → Supplemented to: <strong>$22,750</strong></li>
        <li>Initial offer: $4,500 → Supplemented to: <strong>$14,300</strong></li>
        <li>Initial offer: $12,000 → Supplemented to: <strong>$31,600</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>These aren't outliers — they're typical. The supplement process works.</p>

      <h2>Don't Accept Less Than You Deserve</h2>
      <p>If you've received an insurance estimate that seems too low, it probably is. Contact Austin Insure for a <strong>free second opinion</strong>. We'll review your claim, inspect your property, and fight for every dollar you're owed.</p>

      <p>In Austin, water damage is one of the most common — and most destructive — insurance claims. Whether it's a burst pipe during a winter freeze, flash flooding, or a slow leak that's been hiding behind your walls, <strong>water damage moves fast</strong>. Mold can begin growing in as little as 24 hours, and structural damage compounds by the hour.</p>

      <p>Knowing what to do in the first moments can save you thousands of dollars and months of headaches. Here's your complete emergency response guide.</p>

      <h2>Immediate Actions (First 30 Minutes)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Stop the source:</strong> Shut off the main water valve if the damage is from a pipe. Know where your shut-off valve is <em>before</em> an emergency happens.</li>
        <li><strong>Kill the power:</strong> If water is near electrical outlets, appliances, or your breaker box, turn off electricity to affected areas. Do not step in standing water near electrical sources.</li>
        <li><strong>Move valuables:</strong> Get electronics, documents, photos, and irreplaceable items to dry ground immediately.</li>
        <li><strong>Start documenting:</strong> Take photos and video of the water level, damage, and source before any cleanup begins.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Within the First Hour</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Call your insurance company</strong> to report the damage and start a claim</li>
        <li><strong>Call a professional water restoration team</strong> — industrial-grade extraction equipment is critical for deep water</li>
        <li><strong>Begin removing standing water</strong> with towels, mops, or a wet/dry vacuum if available</li>
        <li><strong>Open windows and doors</strong> (weather permitting) to start air circulation</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Critical First 24 Hours</h2>
      <p>This window is when you either prevent mold or create a mold problem. Here's what needs to happen:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Professional water extraction to remove all standing and absorbed water</li>
        <li>Industrial dehumidifiers and air movers positioned throughout affected areas</li>
        <li>Removal of saturated carpet padding (it rarely dries properly and breeds mold)</li>
        <li>Inspection of wall cavities — water behind drywall is invisible but devastating</li>
        <li>Antimicrobial treatment of affected surfaces</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What Your Insurance Covers (and What It Doesn't)</h2>
      <p>Standard homeowner's policies in Texas typically cover:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ Burst pipes and plumbing failures</li>
        <li>✅ Storm-driven rain entering through roof damage</li>
        <li>✅ Appliance malfunctions (water heater, washing machine)</li>
        <li>✅ Fire suppression water damage</li>
      </ul>
      <p>What's usually <strong>NOT covered:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>❌ Gradual leaks and "maintenance" issues</li>
        <li>❌ Flood damage (requires separate FEMA flood policy)</li>
        <li>❌ Sewer and drain backups (unless you have a rider)</li>
        <li>❌ Mold that results from neglect or delayed remediation</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Austin-Specific Risks</h2>
      <p>Central Texas has unique water damage risks that every homeowner should know:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Winter freezes:</strong> Pipes in exterior walls, attics, and crawl spaces are vulnerable during Texas cold snaps. The February 2021 freeze caused billions in pipe burst damage statewide.</li>
        <li><strong>Flash flooding:</strong> Austin's hilly terrain and clay soil can channel water toward homes rapidly during heavy rains.</li>
        <li><strong>Expansive soil:</strong> Austin's clay soil expands and contracts with moisture, stressing foundations and plumbing.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Get Emergency Help Now</h2>
      <p>Water damage doesn't wait, and neither should you. Austin Insure provides <strong>24/7 emergency water damage response</strong> across Central Texas. We'll extract the water, dry your property, document everything for insurance, and manage your claim from start to finish.</p>

      <p>Your homeowner's insurance policy is one of the most important financial documents you own — and it's written in language specifically designed to be hard to understand. Dense legal jargon, cross-references, exclusions within exclusions... it's no accident that most homeowners have <strong>no idea what their policy actually covers</strong>.</p>

      <p>This guide breaks down the key components of a standard Texas homeowner's insurance policy in plain English, so you know exactly what you're paying for.</p>

      <h2>The Six Standard Coverage Types</h2>
      <p>Most Texas homeowner's policies (called HO-A or HO-B policies) include six types of coverage:</p>

      <h3>Coverage A: Dwelling</h3>
      <p>This covers the physical structure of your home — walls, roof, foundation, built-in appliances, and attached structures like a garage. This is usually the largest dollar amount on your policy.</p>

      <h3>Coverage B: Other Structures</h3>
      <p>Detached structures on your property: fences, sheds, detached garages, pools. Usually set at 10% of your dwelling coverage.</p>

      <h3>Coverage C: Personal Property</h3>
      <p>Your stuff — furniture, electronics, clothing, appliances. Typically 50–70% of dwelling coverage. <strong>Important:</strong> high-value items like jewelry, art, and collectibles usually have sub-limits and may need separate riders.</p>

      <h3>Coverage D: Loss of Use</h3>
      <p>If your home is uninhabitable due to a covered loss, this pays for temporary housing, meals, and living expenses. Often overlooked but incredibly valuable after a fire or major storm.</p>

      <h3>Coverage E: Personal Liability</h3>
      <p>Covers legal and medical costs if someone is injured on your property. Standard limits start at $100,000 but can be increased.</p>

      <h3>Coverage F: Medical Payments</h3>
      <p>Covers minor medical expenses for guests injured on your property, regardless of fault. Usually $1,000–$5,000.</p>

      <h2>What's Covered vs. What's Excluded</h2>
      <p>This is where policies get tricky. Texas uses two main policy types:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>HO-A (Named Peril):</strong> Only covers damage from <em>specifically listed</em> causes — fire, lightning, hail, windstorm, etc. If the cause isn't listed, it's not covered.</li>
        <li><strong>HO-B (Broad Form):</strong> Covers everything <em>except</em> what's specifically excluded. This provides significantly broader protection.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Common Exclusions Every Texan Should Know</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Flood damage:</strong> Never covered by standard policies. Requires a separate NFIP or private flood policy.</li>
        <li><strong>Earth movement:</strong> Subsidence, sinkholes, and foundation settlement are typically excluded.</li>
        <li><strong>Wear and tear:</strong> Gradual deterioration, rust, mold from neglect, and "maintenance" issues.</li>
        <li><strong>Intentional damage:</strong> Self-explanatory, but worth noting.</li>
        <li><strong>Certain dog breeds:</strong> Some policies exclude liability for breeds deemed "aggressive."</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Understanding Your Deductible</h2>
      <p>In Texas, most policies have two deductibles:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Standard deductible:</strong> A flat dollar amount (typically $1,000–$2,500) for non-wind/hail claims.</li>
        <li><strong>Wind/hail deductible:</strong> Usually a <em>percentage</em> of your dwelling coverage (1–2%). On a $300,000 home, a 2% wind/hail deductible is $6,000. Many homeowners are shocked by this number.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Replacement Cost vs. Actual Cash Value</h2>
      <p>This distinction can mean tens of thousands of dollars:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Replacement Cost Value (RCV):</strong> Pays to replace damaged items with new equivalents. This is what you want.</li>
        <li><strong>Actual Cash Value (ACV):</strong> Pays the depreciated value — what your 10-year-old roof is "worth" today, not what a new one costs. Significantly less money.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Check your policy declarations page. If you have an ACV policy, consider upgrading to RCV before your next renewal.</p>

      <h2>Texas-Specific Insurance Laws That Protect You</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Insurers must acknowledge your claim within 15 days</li>
        <li>They must accept or deny within 15 business days of receiving all documentation</li>
        <li>Payment must be issued within 5 business days of approval</li>
        <li>You have the right to hire your own contractor — they cannot force you to use theirs</li>
        <li>You can file a complaint with the Texas Department of Insurance if your insurer acts in bad faith</li>
      </ul>

    content: `
      <p>Central Texas sits squarely in what meteorologists call "Hail Alley." From March through June, powerful supercell thunderstorms routinely pound the Austin metro with hailstones ranging from pea-sized to softball-sized. <strong>The Insurance Council of Texas reports that hail damage accounts for more than $1 billion in claims annually</strong> across the state.</p>

      <p>The tricky thing about hail damage? It's often invisible from the ground. You might not notice anything wrong until water starts dripping through your ceiling six months later. By then, the damage has compounded — and your insurance company may argue it's not storm-related.</p>

      <h2>How to Identify Hail Damage on Your Roof</h2>
      <p>After any hail event in the Austin area, look for these telltale signs:</p>

      <h3>Asphalt Shingles</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Dark spots or bruises:</strong> Hail impacts displace the protective granules, leaving dark, exposed spots that feel soft when pressed</li>
        <li><strong>Cracked shingles:</strong> Larger hailstones can fracture shingles on impact</li>
        <li><strong>Missing granules:</strong> Check your gutters and downspouts — a buildup of granules after a storm is a red flag</li>
        <li><strong>Dented or split shingles:</strong> Look for circular impact marks, especially on the slopes facing the direction the storm came from</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Metal Components</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Dented gutters and downspouts:</strong> These are soft aluminum and show hail damage easily</li>
        <li><strong>Damaged flashing:</strong> Dents around chimneys, vents, and roof transitions</li>
        <li><strong>Roof vents and caps:</strong> Metal roof vents are excellent hail indicators</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Ground-Level Evidence</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Dented mailbox, fence caps, or outdoor furniture</li>
        <li>Cracked window screens or damaged shutters</li>
        <li>Pockmarks on painted wood surfaces (fascia, window trim)</li>
        <li>Dented AC condenser fins on your outdoor unit</li>
        <li>Dings on your car (check for fresh, unrepaired dents)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why You Should Never Ignore Hail Damage</h2>
      <p>Many homeowners make the mistake of thinking "it doesn't look that bad" and ignoring hail damage. This is a costly error. Here's what happens when hail damage goes unrepaired:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Granule loss accelerates aging:</strong> Those tiny granules protect your shingles from UV rays. Without them, shingles deteriorate 3–5x faster</li>
        <li><strong>Micro-cracks become leaks:</strong> Hairline fractures from hail impact expand with temperature cycles, eventually allowing water penetration</li>
        <li><strong>Voided warranties:</strong> Some shingle manufacturers will void your warranty if documented hail damage isn't addressed</li>
        <li><strong>Harder insurance claims:</strong> The longer you wait to file, the harder it is to prove the damage was storm-related and not "wear and tear"</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Austin Hail Season Timeline</h2>
      <p>Understanding when hail is most likely helps you stay prepared:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>March–April:</strong> Spring storms begin. Hail events start increasing in frequency</li>
        <li><strong>May–June:</strong> Peak hail season. This is when the largest, most damaging hail typically occurs</li>
        <li><strong>July–August:</strong> Frequency decreases but isolated supercells can still produce significant hail</li>
        <li><strong>September–November:</strong> Occasional fall storms, though less common</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What to Do After a Hail Storm in Austin</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Wait for safety:</strong> Don't climb on your roof. Let a professional inspect it</li>
        <li><strong>Document from the ground:</strong> Photograph any visible damage to gutters, siding, cars, and outdoor equipment</li>
        <li><strong>Check your neighbors:</strong> If three homes on your block have damage, yours almost certainly does too</li>
        <li><strong>Call for a free professional inspection</strong> within 48 hours — this creates a time-stamped record</li>
        <li><strong>File your insurance claim</strong> promptly. In Texas, you typically have one year from the date of damage</li>
        <li><strong>Do NOT sign with storm chasers</strong> who go door-to-door. Work with a licensed, local contractor</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Your roof is the most expensive component of your home to replace — typically $8,000 to $25,000+ depending on size and materials. When storm damage strikes, your homeowner's insurance policy should cover the cost. But <strong>the claims process can be confusing, time-consuming, and full of pitfalls</strong> that can cost you thousands if you're not careful.</p>

      <p>This is the definitive guide to filing a roof insurance claim in Texas. Follow these steps exactly and you'll maximize your chances of a full, fair payout.</p>

      <h2>Step 1: Determine If You Have a Valid Claim</h2>
      <p>Not all roof damage is covered by insurance. Texas homeowner's policies generally cover:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ Hail damage</li>
        <li>✅ Wind damage (including tornado)</li>
        <li>✅ Falling objects (tree limbs, debris)</li>
        <li>✅ Fire damage</li>
        <li>✅ Ice/snow weight damage</li>
      </ul>
      <p>What's typically <strong>NOT covered:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>❌ Normal wear and tear</li>
        <li>❌ Poor maintenance or neglect</li>
        <li>❌ Pre-existing damage before your policy start date</li>
        <li>❌ Cosmetic-only damage (some policies exclude this)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Step 2: Get a Professional Roof Inspection</h2>
      <p>Before filing your claim, have a <strong>licensed roofing contractor</strong> inspect your roof. This is critical for several reasons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>They can identify damage you can't see from the ground</li>
        <li>Their inspection report provides independent documentation</li>
        <li>They can estimate the full scope and cost of repairs</li>
        <li>A contractor's report carries weight with insurance adjusters</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> A reputable contractor will inspect your roof for free. If they charge for an inspection, that's a warning sign.</p>

      <h2>Step 3: File Your Claim</h2>
      <p>Contact your insurance company to open a claim. You can do this by phone or through their app/website. Be prepared to provide:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Date the damage occurred (or was discovered)</li>
        <li>Description of the damage</li>
        <li>Photos and video documentation</li>
        <li>Your contractor's inspection report (if available)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Write down your <strong>claim number</strong> and the name of the claims representative assigned to you.</p>

      <h2>Step 4: The Insurance Adjuster's Inspection</h2>
      <p>Your insurance company will send their own adjuster to inspect the damage. This is one of the most important moments in your claim. Here's how to prepare:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Have your contractor present</strong> — they can point out damage the adjuster might miss</li>
        <li><strong>Provide your own documentation</strong> — share your photos, videos, and the contractor's report</li>
        <li><strong>Be present yourself</strong> — listen to the adjuster's comments and take notes</li>
        <li><strong>Don't agree to anything on the spot</strong> — review any documents before signing</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Step 5: Review the Insurance Estimate</h2>
      <p>After the inspection, you'll receive a written estimate from your insurer. Review it carefully:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Compare it line-by-line with your contractor's estimate</li>
        <li>Check that all damaged areas are included</li>
        <li>Verify the measurements (roof area in squares)</li>
        <li>Look for items listed as "O&P not included" — overhead and profit should be included for legitimate claims</li>
        <li>Confirm the material types and quality match what you currently have</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Step 6: File a Supplement if Needed</h2>
      <p>If the insurer's estimate is lower than your contractor's assessment — and it usually is — your contractor can file a <strong>supplement</strong>. This is a formal request for additional funds supported by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Additional documentation of missed damage</li>
        <li>Corrected measurements</li>
        <li>Updated material pricing</li>
        <li>Photos of hidden damage found during tear-off</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Supplements are routine in the industry. Don't be intimidated — this is how you get a full, fair payout.</p>

      <h2>Step 7: Complete the Repairs</h2>
      <p>Once your claim is approved (including any supplements), your contractor will schedule the work. For a typical roof replacement in Austin, expect:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1–2 days for tear-off and installation</li>
        <li>Materials ordered 3–5 days before start date</li>
        <li>Final inspection upon completion</li>
        <li>Warranty documentation for both workmanship and materials</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Important Texas Deadlines to Know</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Filing deadline:</strong> You typically have 1 year from the date of damage to file a claim</li>
        <li><strong>Insurer response:</strong> Must acknowledge within 15 days of receiving your claim</li>
        <li><strong>Decision deadline:</strong> Must accept or deny within 15 business days of receiving all necessary information</li>
        <li><strong>Payment:</strong> Must issue payment within 5 business days of approval</li>
        <li><strong>Recoverable depreciation:</strong> Must be claimed within the time specified in your policy (usually 180 days after loss settlement)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>You filed your insurance claim. You waited weeks. And then the letter came: <strong>"Your claim has been denied."</strong></p>

      <p>If this has happened to you, you're not alone. Insurance companies deny claims every day — and the reasons range from legitimate to outright questionable. The good news? <strong>A denial is not the final answer.</strong> In Texas, you have significant legal rights to challenge, appeal, and overturn a denied claim.</p>

      <h2>Why Claims Get Denied</h2>
      <p>Understanding the reason for denial is the first step to fighting it. Common reasons include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>"Pre-existing damage":</strong> The insurer claims the damage existed before the storm event</li>
        <li><strong>"Wear and tear":</strong> They classify the damage as maintenance-related rather than storm-caused</li>
        <li><strong>"Cosmetic only":</strong> Some policies exclude damage that doesn't affect the function of the roof</li>
        <li><strong>"Filed too late":</strong> The claim was submitted outside the policy's filing window</li>
        <li><strong>"Insufficient documentation":</strong> The insurer says there's not enough evidence of covered damage</li>
        <li><strong>"Policy exclusion":</strong> The specific type of damage or cause falls under an exclusion in your policy</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Your Legal Rights Under Texas Law</h2>
      <p>Texas has some of the strongest consumer protection laws for insurance claims in the country. Here's what you need to know:</p>

      <h3>Right to a Written Explanation</h3>
      <p>Your insurer must provide a <strong>written explanation</strong> of why your claim was denied, including the specific policy language they're relying on.</p>

      <h3>Right to Appeal</h3>
      <p>You can formally dispute the denial and request a re-inspection or re-review. Submit new evidence, updated documentation, or a second professional opinion.</p>

      <h3>Right to File a Complaint</h3>
      <p>The <strong>Texas Department of Insurance (TDI)</strong> accepts complaints against insurers. Filing a TDI complaint creates a formal record and often prompts insurers to reconsider.</p>

      <h3>Right to Appraisal</h3>
      <p>Most Texas homeowner's policies include an "appraisal clause." If you and your insurer can't agree on the amount of damage, either party can invoke appraisal — a binding process where independent appraisers determine the fair value.</p>

      <h3>Right to Legal Action</h3>
      <p>If your insurer has acted in bad faith — delaying, underpaying, or wrongfully denying your claim — you can file a lawsuit under the Texas Insurance Code and the DTPA (Deceptive Trade Practices Act). Courts can award up to <strong>3x the damages</strong> plus attorney fees in bad faith cases.</p>

      <h2>Step-by-Step: What to Do After a Denial</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Read the denial letter carefully.</strong> Identify the specific reason and policy section cited</li>
        <li><strong>Review your policy.</strong> Verify whether the denial reason is actually supported by your coverage terms</li>
        <li><strong>Get a second professional inspection.</strong> A licensed contractor can provide documentation that contradicts the denial</li>
        <li><strong>File a formal appeal</strong> with your insurer, including all new evidence and documentation</li>
        <li><strong>Request re-inspection</strong> and have your contractor present to point out missed damage</li>
        <li><strong>File a TDI complaint</strong> if the insurer doesn't respond fairly</li>
        <li><strong>Invoke appraisal</strong> if you disagree on the damage amount</li>
        <li><strong>Consult an attorney</strong> if the insurer is acting in bad faith</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Every year, Central Texas gets hammered by severe thunderstorms, hail, high winds, and occasional tornadoes. <strong>The average Austin homeowner files a weather-related insurance claim every 7–10 years.</strong> The question isn't if a storm will affect your home — it's when.</p>

      <p>The good news? A few hours of preparation before storm season can dramatically reduce damage, speed up any insurance claim you might need to file, and give you peace of mind when the storms roll in.</p>

      <h2>Roof and Exterior Checklist</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Schedule a professional roof inspection.</strong> A licensed contractor can spot vulnerable areas — loose flashing, aging shingles, compromised seals — before a storm exploits them</li>
        <li><strong>Clean your gutters and downspouts.</strong> Clogged gutters cause water to back up under your roof edge, leading to interior leaks and fascia rot</li>
        <li><strong>Trim tree branches.</strong> Cut back any branches within 10 feet of your roof. Falling limbs are one of the top causes of storm damage in Austin</li>
        <li><strong>Inspect siding and windows.</strong> Seal any cracks or gaps where wind-driven rain could enter</li>
        <li><strong>Secure outdoor items.</strong> Patio furniture, trash cans, and decorations become projectiles in high winds. Store or anchor them</li>
        <li><strong>Check your fence.</strong> Loose fence panels can blow free and damage your home (or your neighbor's)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Interior Preparation</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Know your water shut-off valve location.</strong> If a pipe bursts during a freeze or from storm damage, you need to stop the water flow immediately</li>
        <li><strong>Test your sump pump</strong> if you have one. Pour water into the pit to make sure it activates</li>
        <li><strong>Clear your drains.</strong> Floor drains, bath drains, and washing machine drains should flow freely</li>
        <li><strong>Create a home inventory.</strong> Photograph every room, document valuable items, and store receipts. This is invaluable if you need to file a claim</li>
        <li><strong>Back up important documents.</strong> Insurance policies, deeds, and financial documents should be stored digitally and in a waterproof safe</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Review Your Insurance Policy</h2>
      <p>Before storm season is the perfect time to review your coverage:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Check your wind/hail deductible.</strong> In Texas, this is usually a percentage (1–2%) of your dwelling coverage, not a flat dollar amount. On a $400,000 home, a 2% deductible is $8,000</li>
        <li><strong>Verify you have replacement cost coverage</strong> (not actual cash value) for your roof</li>
        <li><strong>Confirm your dwelling coverage amount</strong> reflects current construction costs — material prices have surged in recent years</li>
        <li><strong>Consider adding flood insurance</strong> if you're in or near a flood-prone area. Standard policies never cover flooding</li>
        <li><strong>Ask about endorsements</strong> for cosmetic hail damage, which some Texas policies now exclude</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Build an Emergency Kit</h2>
      <p>Every Austin household should have a storm emergency kit ready:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Flashlights and extra batteries</li>
        <li>Battery-powered weather radio</li>
        <li>First aid kit</li>
        <li>3 days of water (1 gallon per person per day)</li>
        <li>Non-perishable food and manual can opener</li>
        <li>Phone chargers and backup battery packs</li>
        <li>Important documents in a waterproof bag</li>
        <li>Tarps, duct tape, and a basic tool kit for emergency board-ups</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Get a Pre-Storm Season Inspection</h2>
      <p>Austin Insure offers <strong>free pre-season roof and exterior inspections</strong>. We'll identify vulnerabilities, document the current condition of your property (invaluable if you later need to file a claim), and recommend any preventive repairs.

      <p>You filed your insurance claim. The adjuster came out. And the check you received is… not even close to what repairs actually cost. Now what?</p>

      <p>This is where the <strong>insurance claim supplement</strong> comes in — and it's the single most powerful tool homeowners have to close the gap between what their insurer offered and what the repairs actually cost. Yet most homeowners don't even know it exists.</p>

      <h2>What Is an Insurance Supplement?</h2>
      <p>A supplement is a <strong>formal request for additional funds</strong> submitted to your insurance company after the initial claim has been processed. It's supported by documentation showing that the original estimate was incomplete, inaccurate, or underpriced.</p>
      <p>Supplements are completely normal in the insurance industry. Adjusters, contractors, and carriers all understand and expect them. There is <strong>no penalty</strong> for filing a supplement — it's simply part of the process.</p>

      <h2>When You Need a Supplement</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The initial estimate missed damage:</strong> Adjusters often spend limited time on-site and can miss hidden or secondary damage</li>
        <li><strong>Hidden damage discovered during repairs:</strong> Once a roof is torn off or drywall is opened, additional damage is frequently revealed</li>
        <li><strong>Pricing discrepancies:</strong> The insurer's estimate uses rates below actual market costs for Austin-area labor and materials</li>
        <li><strong>Code upgrades required:</strong> Local building codes may require upgrades (better materials, additional ventilation) that weren't in the original estimate</li>
        <li><strong>Overhead and profit excluded:</strong> Insurance estimates should include O&P for legitimate contractor costs</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How the Supplement Process Works</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Your contractor identifies the gap</strong> between the insurance estimate and the actual repair cost</li>
        <li><strong>They prepare a detailed supplement package</strong> including photos, measurements, material specifications, and an Xactimate estimate</li>
        <li><strong>The supplement is submitted</strong> to the insurance company's claims department</li>
        <li><strong>A desk review or re-inspection</strong> occurs — the insurer may send another adjuster or review it internally</li>
        <li><strong>Negotiation</strong> — back-and-forth discussions on line items until agreement is reached</li>
        <li><strong>Additional funds are approved</strong> and a supplemental check is issued</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Real Supplement Results From Austin Claims</h2>
      <p>Here's what proper supplements have achieved for our clients:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Roof claim: $9,800 initial → <strong>$24,600 after supplement</strong> (151% increase)</li>
        <li>Water damage: $5,200 initial → <strong>$16,800 after supplement</strong> (223% increase)</li>
        <li>Storm damage: $14,500 initial → <strong>$38,200 after supplement</strong> (163% increase)</li>
        <li>Fire damage: $22,000 initial → <strong>$67,500 after supplement</strong> (207% increase)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These aren't exceptions — they're typical outcomes when a qualified contractor advocates for you.</p>

      <h2>Why Most Homeowners Miss Out</h2>
      <p>There are three main reasons homeowners leave supplement money on the table:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>They don't know supplements exist.</strong> Insurance companies don't advertise this option</li>
        <li><strong>They accept the first check.</strong> The insurer's initial offer creates an anchor point that most people assume is final</li>
        <li><strong>They hire contractors who don't handle supplements.</strong> Many budget contractors just work with whatever the insurer approves — leaving thousands of dollars uncollected</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Nothing strikes fear into a homeowner's heart quite like the word "mold." And in Austin's subtropical climate — where summer humidity routinely tops 80% — <strong>mold growth after water damage isn't just possible, it's almost guaranteed</strong> if you don't act fast.</p>

      <p>Understanding how mold develops, how to prevent it, and what your insurance will (and won't) cover can save you thousands of dollars and protect your family's health.</p>

      <h2>How Fast Does Mold Grow After Water Damage?</h2>
      <p>The timeline is alarming:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Within 24–48 hours:</strong> Mold spores begin colonizing wet surfaces. You may not see anything yet, but microscopic growth has started</li>
        <li><strong>3–7 days:</strong> Visible mold colonies appear on drywall, carpet padding, wood, and insulation</li>
        <li><strong>1–2 weeks:</strong> Mold spreads to adjacent areas through air circulation. Musty odor becomes noticeable</li>
        <li><strong>2+ weeks:</strong> Structural materials begin to degrade. Health effects may appear in sensitive individuals</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In Austin's warm climate, these timelines can be <strong>accelerated</strong>. Our average temperatures and humidity levels create ideal growing conditions for the most common household mold types.</p>

      <h2>The Health Risks Are Real</h2>
      <p>Mold exposure can cause a range of health issues, particularly for children, elderly individuals, and those with respiratory conditions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Chronic coughing and sneezing</li>
        <li>Eye, nose, and throat irritation</li>
        <li>Skin rashes and allergic reactions</li>
        <li>Asthma attacks or worsening respiratory symptoms</li>
        <li>Headaches, fatigue, and difficulty concentrating</li>
        <li>In severe cases, fungal lung infections</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Important:</strong> You do not need to see mold to be affected by it. Mold growing behind walls, under floors, or in HVAC systems can release spores throughout your home.</p>

      <h2>Where Mold Hides After Water Damage</h2>
      <p>Mold doesn't always grow where you can see it. The most common hidden locations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Behind drywall:</strong> Water wicks up drywall from the floor, creating a moist cavity behind the wall surface</li>
        <li><strong>Under carpet padding:</strong> Padding absorbs water like a sponge and almost never dries completely</li>
        <li><strong>Inside wall cavities:</strong> Plumbing leaks can keep framing lumber wet for weeks</li>
        <li><strong>In the HVAC system:</strong> Moisture in ducts and on coils creates perfect mold environments</li>
        <li><strong>Under cabinets and appliances:</strong> Kitchen and bathroom water damage often goes unnoticed under cabinetry</li>
        <li><strong>In the attic:</strong> Roof leaks can saturate insulation, which holds moisture and promotes mold growth</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Preventing Mold After Water Damage</h2>
      <p>The key is speed. Here's what must happen within the first 24–48 hours:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Extract all standing water</strong> using professional-grade equipment</li>
        <li><strong>Remove saturated materials</strong> — carpet padding, insulation, and heavily soaked drywall must come out</li>
        <li><strong>Deploy industrial dehumidifiers</strong> to bring humidity below 50% in affected areas</li>
        <li><strong>Set up air movers</strong> to accelerate drying in wall cavities and under flooring</li>
        <li><strong>Apply antimicrobial treatment</strong> to all exposed surfaces</li>
        <li><strong>Monitor moisture levels</strong> daily with professional-grade meters until the structure is fully dry</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Does Insurance Cover Mold?</h2>
      <p>This is one of the most confusing areas of homeowner's insurance. The short answer: <strong>it depends on the cause.</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ <strong>Covered:</strong> Mold resulting from a <em>covered peril</em> — such as a burst pipe, storm-driven rain through a damaged roof, or fire suppression water. If the water damage is covered, the resulting mold cleanup is typically covered too</li>
        <li>❌ <strong>NOT Covered:</strong> Mold from ongoing maintenance issues, gradual leaks, humidity, or condensation. If the water source isn't a covered peril, the mold cleanup won't be covered</li>
        <li>⚠️ <strong>Gray area:</strong> Mold that develops because you <em>failed to mitigate</em> the original water damage. If a covered water event occurred but you waited too long to address it, the insurer may argue the mold is your responsibility</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Many Texas policies also have <strong>mold coverage caps</strong> — typically $10,000 to $25,000 — regardless of actual remediation costs.</p>
